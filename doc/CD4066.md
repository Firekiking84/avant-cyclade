# CD4066B CMOS Bilateral switch

The CD4066B device is a quad bilateral switch intended
for the transmission or multiplexing of analog or digital signals.
It has a low on-state resistance allowing it to be easier to activate.

he CD4066B device consists of four bilateral switches, each with independent controls.
Wide operating supply of 3V to 18V allows for use in a broad array of applications.

The advantages over single-channel switches include peak input-signal voltage swings equal to the full supply voltage and more constant on-state impedance over the input-signal range.

##### VDD and VSS can be any value as long as 3V ≤ (VDD – VSS) ≤ 24V, and the minimum VDD is met.
##### All Signals voltage must be between VDD and VSS.
##### Tie any unused signals to Ground.
